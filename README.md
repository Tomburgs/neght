# Neght
Neght — Next + GitHub with a speech impediment

### Why 💭
Because I wanted to create an easier way to build and deploy static next pages to GitHub pages.
Sort of like [Storybook Deployer](https://github.com/storybook-eol/storybook-deployer), but for Next.

### How 👩‍🔧
Simply configure your Next project to [create a static export](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports#configuration), add neght as a dependency, and voila.
